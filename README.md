# Second PU practical files

Repository contains two folders, namely C++ and HTML. These folders contain the
 files that would be useful to execute the programs which might have otherwise 
 been discussed in labs if it weren't for the current situation.

Folder structure is as follows:

### HTML
Contains only two files, the [form page](https://github.com/riskycase/pu2-computer/blob/trunk/html/form.html)
, and the [action page](https://github.com/riskycase/pu2-computer/blob/trunk/html/action.html).

The above links show the source code, final output can be seen [here](https://riskycase.github.io/pu2-computer/html/form)

### C++
There are 16 programs in this folder, each having the source code in the file 
ending with `.cpp` and the compiled output in `.exe` format.

Users who have a Windows device can directly run the `.exe` files. Users who 
do not have a Windows device may use the source code and compile it in an IDE.
